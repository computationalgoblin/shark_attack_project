# Shark Attack Project 

This is a project completed as a practical activity for Ironhack in collaboration with Laura Ballesteros.

The project's goal is to predict the fatality of a potential shark attack. To accomplish this classification, we implemented a logistic regression model.

We monitored the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

Included among the files are:

- A PDF named "scope_of_work," where you can observe a screenshot of a Gantt chart that I used to organize the project as a project manager.
- An individual notebook created by me, containing the data cleaning phase, exploratory data analysis, and an initial implementation of the model.
- A group notebook that serves as the final product, presenting the model after an optimization process and concluding the project.
- The cleaned dataframe

One of the major challenges we encountered in the project was the extensive data cleaning required, which involved a significant learning curve for me. It has been a valuable experience, and I am satisfied with the outcomes.

Many thanks to Laura for her collaboration!
